# labels: forked from fclabels

Non-arrow fork of fclabels. Using two (possibly monadic) contexts, one for getting and one for modification.

- Includes total, partial, monomorphic, polymorphic, restricted, failing, and pointwise labels.
- Allow monadic updates using traverse.
- Includes a bunch of labels for the base library.
- TH codegen for automatic label derivation.
